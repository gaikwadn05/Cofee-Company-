                    <p>We came across Lima Gold Plantations by chance during our visit to Ethiopia in 2018. Ever
                        since then, we’ve been mesmerized by the blends from this amazing estate. And your love
                        for unique blends from this plantation makes our association strong.

                    <p>This popular estate was the subject of intrigue after a number of UFO videos emerged from
                        the region in 2008. We’re sure the UFOs were there for the amazing Arabica that they
                        cultivate over there. And we agree. Attaca produces some of the finest coffee and we’ve got
                        them all to prove our point.

                    <p>Our coffee hunt in South India sprung up a surprise in 2019 when we came across Mr.
                        Rajamani Vardha who’s great grandfather established Vardha Plantations in Karnataka, India
                        in the late 1800s on orders of a British general who wanted great coffee. More than a
                        century later, Vardha Plantations still produce their uniquely amazing blend that has come
                        to be a crowd favourite with us

            <h1>History</h1>
            <p>The year was 1980 when WakeCup was imagined after experiencing some of the finest
                coffees on an educational trip to Brazil and the South Americas. We wanted to break the
                monotony of low profile, non-descript coffee that was doing rounds in those cafeterias of the
                80s. But life threw us in a different direction, and we ended up in the tech industry with a
                desire to get into the world of coffee someday.</p>
            <p>
                In 2005, that dream was brought to fruition when we quit our jobs and started WakeCup.
                Ever since then, we’ve gone around the world in search for the best beans and we couldn’t
                be happier. We love spreading smiles through our coffee. Our quest has taken us around the
                world to some of the finest plantations and estates, many of whom work with us directly or
                indirectly.</p>
            <p>
                In 2016 we started conducting workshops and became the primary sponsors of the Bean King
                Champion contest. Our baristas have won global accolades and we love serving cuppa
                goodness.</p>
